DNS Request:

Immediately you type a URL in your browser it sends it to DNS ( Domain Name Systems) server to resolve the name into an IP address, so the DNS server looks up the IP address associated with the domain name and sends it back to the browser.



TCP/IP:

Once the server gets the IP address it opens a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the web server that hosts the website, this ensures that data sent between browser and server is reliable and error free.



FIREWALL:

Before the browser can establish a connection with the web server, it must pass through any firewalls or security measures in place. These firewalls protect the server from unauthorized access and attacks.



HTTPS/SSL:

If the website uses HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure), the browser will negotiate an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection with the web server. This SSL connection encrypts all data sent between the browser and server, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted by anyone else.



LOAD-BALANCER:

This is for large websites that receive a lot of traffic, there may be multiple web servers behind a load-balancer. The load-balancer distributes incoming traffic across the web servers to ensure that no single server gets overloaded.



 WEB SERVER:

Once connected, web sever receives the HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) request from browser, web server processes the request to generates HTTP response which contain source code (html, CSS, JavaScript etc.) and others material to display webpage.

Next time you browse the web, take a moment to appreciate the complex and intricate processes that happen behind the scenes to make it all possible.
